# Welcome to Ruby Bench

## Introduction

RubyBench runs, stores and visualizes benchmarks for ruby projects. It helps developers with feedback when their framework or platform is getting slower or faster.

Finding out about regressions months in to the development cycle can often incur a massive cost, fixing bugs early on is cheap. Often small changes can lead to unexpected gains or losses.

RubyBench was born out from [Sam Saffron's call](https://samsaffron.com/archive/2013/12/11/call-to-action-long-running-ruby-benchmark) for a long running Ruby benchmarks.
